# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
# git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'
# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal
# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
